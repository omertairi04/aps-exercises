A text is given, organized into multiple sections. Your task is to determine whether the text is valid according to the given organizational rules.

    Each section starts with \begin{section}, \begin{subsection} or \begin{subsubsection}
    Each section ends with \end{section}, \end{subsection} or \end{subsubsection}. The level of the opening tag has to match the level of the closing tag. ((\begin{subsection} must always be closed with (\end{subsection} , and so on.)
    Sections can be nested, but a nested section must have a lower level than the one it is nested inside. For example, a section cannot be nested inside a subsection, but a subsection can be nested inside a section. The section levels have to be consecutive (A subsubsection can't be nested directly inside a section and a subsection can't appear outside of a section).

Apart from sections, the text can contain regular content, which can only appear in a block that starts with \begin{text} and ends with \end{text}. A text block can't contain any level of section nested inside. A text block can appear both outside, and nested within any level of section.

Input: The first line contains an integer N representing the number of lines in the text. The next N lines each contain a single line of text.

Output: Print true if the text is valid according to the rules, otherwise print false.
Example:

Input:
10
\begin{section}
\begin{subsection}
\begin{text}
Subsection content
\end{text}
\end{subsection}
\begin{text}
Some more text
\end{text}
\end{section}


Output: true

For example:

Input

10
\begin{section}
\begin{subsection}
\begin{text}
Subsection content
\end{text}
\end{subsection}
\begin{text}
Some more text
\end{text}
\end{section}


Result
true
